# League of Legend Memory (Clicky) Game

### Overview

This app is a memory game built with React. The idea of the game is to click on the cards without clicking on the same one twice until you click all 16 cards once. Clicking the same card twice will reset your score. 

# How It Works:

1. Click any of League of Legends Champions to begin.

2. The application should render different images to the screen once user clicks an image.

3. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0, if clicked the same image more than once.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page randomize themselves in a random order.

5. Score the highest points and will render on the screen.
